# cinisg
This is a C-Addaptation of the library created for the inisg-project in C++ by [N0ffie](https://github.com/Knoficooki/inisg)

## How to use
cinisg is a single header library,\
to use it you have to include the implementation in a C-Source file like this:

```cpp
#define INISG_IMPLEMENTATION
#include <inisg.h>
``` 

## Differece to inisg
This is just to load the ini-file and unparse it.
The actuall commandline functionlity is not provided and not the idea of this project

# Future
I'm looking forward to learn about the usage of C in C++ to handle errors, if somebody has a tip for me, please create a issue.
